= To Do

This is an informal list of tasks yet to be done for the MUES.

* Update CommandShell and commands to use a less-verbose means of
  command-creation. They should probably just be instances of the same class
  with singleton methods that implement the actual command functionality:

    quitCommand = UserCommand::create({
		:name		=> 'quit',
		:synonyms	=> %w{logout},
		:shortDesc	=> %Q{Disconnect from the server},
		:longDesc	=> %Q{Disconnect from the server, saving any connected } +
					   %Q{characters and the state of your shell.},
		:usage		=> 'quit',
	}) {|context, args|
		return [ MUES::UserSaveEvent ]
	}

* Finish updating Engine with new Listeners code -- still need to hook up the
  disconnect cycle to allow the listener to re-register itself with the engine's
  poll object, or whatever else it might need to do.

* Update docs in the Engine to reflect changes.
