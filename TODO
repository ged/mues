= To Do

This is an informal list of tasks yet to be done for the MUES.

* Update docs in the Engine to reflect changes (partially done already).

* Change the 'pp' command to use YAML if it's loaded, and fall back to 'pp' if
  not.

* Fix the PI-parsing part of MUES::Config::Element.

* Fix /eval CommandShell command by making it use an event that gets executed by
  the privileged queue.

* Finish design/implementation of MUES::ClassLibrary.

* Finish OutputEvent decorators for wrapping, paged output, markup, etc. Undo
  current unfinished class-per-decoration implementation for a
  Decorator-pattern-based approach.

* Finish unit tests.

* Fix the mysterious backspace-freezing bug in the TelnetOutputFilter.

* Make a list of CommandShell commands to implement, and start implementing
  them.
