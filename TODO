= To Do

This is an informal list of tasks yet to be done for the MUES.

== Immediate Tasks

* Make the password strictness in the User questionnaires configurable.

* Add applicable telnet options to the parameters hash for MUES::TelnetListener.

* I18n via GetText:
  http://home2.highway.ne.jp/mutoh/tools/ruby/en/ruby-gettext.html

* Finish unit tests.

* Finish design/implementation of MUES::ClassLibrary.

* Finish metaclass editor.

* Finish OutputEvent decorators for wrapping, paged output, markup, etc. Undo
  current unfinished class-per-decoration implementation for a
  Decorator-pattern-based approach.

* Implement the commands in server/shellCommands/TODO.

* Finish code to re-write a config file.

* Add 'bans' code to Engine.

* Finish the DBI ObjectStore backend.

* Add other backends for other kinds of storage.

* TelnetOutputFilter:

  - Cleanup/refactor some of the really heinously long methods.

  - Add telnet option configuration parameters to the constructor, and make more
    use of some of the useful telnet (sub-)?options.

* Finish the documentation of the config file in ./CONFIGURATION. This can
  mostly be assembled from the comments in server/minimal-config.xml, but
  elaboration of the values and what they do will be in order.

* Rewrite the login system to use MUES::Questionnaire.

* Work on an OutputFilter (probably a derivative of TelnetOutputFilter) that
  uses readline or has readline-like capabilities.

* Better and more-useful error-handling. Errors from Environments should never
  crash the server.

* Make it possible to configure all aspects of login semantics. Should be able
  to go directly from login to environment, give them a command shell if they're
  not an admin, etc. (reltuk's idea on IRC)
