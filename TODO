= To Do

This is an informal list of tasks yet to be done for the MUES.

== Immediate Tasks

* Core

  - Add 'bans' code to Engine.

  - I18n via GetText:
	http://home2.highway.ne.jp/mutoh/tools/ruby/en/ruby-gettext.html

  - Finish unit tests.

  - Better and more-useful error-handling. Errors from Environments should never
	crash the server.

* ObjectStore

  - Fix flatfile backend to keep the store locked and open (as opposed to
    re-opening the file every time) while it is in existance. This may require
    ripping some code out of PStore, or perhaps using an alternative similar
    library like HStore (http://www.sevasoftware.com/hstore) or 

  - Finish the DBI ObjectStore backend.

  - Add other backends for other kinds of storage.

  - Integrate Ryan Pavlik's Criteria module (http://mephle.org/Criteria/)?

* IO Subsystem:

  - Cleanup/refactor some of the really heinously long methods in
    TelnetOutputFilter.

  - Finish OutputEvent decorators for wrapping, paged output, markup, etc. Undo
	current unfinished class-per-decoration implementation for a
	Decorator-pattern-based approach.

  - Add telnet option configuration parameters to the constructor, and make more
    use of some of the useful telnet (sub-)?options.

  - Work on an OutputFilter (probably a derivative of TelnetOutputFilter) that
	uses readline or has readline-like capabilities.

  - Implement the commands in server/shellCommands/TODO.
