= To Do

This is an informal list of tasks yet to be done for the MUES.

* Update docs in the Engine to reflect changes (partially done already).

* Change the 'pp' command to use YAML if it's loaded, and fall back to 'pp' if
  not.

* Write the user maintenance commands (partially done -- requires much more
  testing).

* Fix the PI-parsing part of MUES::Config::Element.

* Fix /roles CommandShell command:
    Internal command error in roles 
	(/home/deveiant/source/ruby/MUES/server/shellCommands/environments.cmd:198):
	 NoMethodError: undefined method `getEnvironment' for #<MUES::Engine:0x40493084>
        lib/mues/Mixins.rb:426:in `getEnvironment'
        (eval):15:in `invoke'

* Fix /eval CommandShell command by making it use an event that gets executed by
  the privileged queue.

* Finish design/implementation of MUES::ClassLibrary.

* Finish OutputEvent decorators for wrapping, paged output, markup, etc. Undo
  current unfinished class-per-decoration implementation for a
  Decorator-pattern-based approach.

* Finish unit tests.
