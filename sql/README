                         MUES Mysql ObjectStore Schema
                         -----------------------------

The files in this directory are an experimental schema for storing MUES
objectstore data in a MySQL database. It's been lightly tested, but there are of
course no guarantees.

To install this schema in a running MySQL database, first edit the MUES.sql
file, particularly the line:

        IDENTIFIED BY '<changme>';

The '<changme>' should be the password the MUES server should use to connect to
the database. The corresponding 'Password' value in the ObjectStore section of
the config file should be the same as the value you put here.

Next, either edit the 'createTables.sh' script to suit your particular
situation, or run a version of the following command from the 'sql' directory:

  $ cpp MUES.sql | mysql -vv --host=mysqlhost -p

As usual, comments/suggestions/patches welcomed.
