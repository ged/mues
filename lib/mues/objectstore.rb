# == Synopsis
#
#   require "ObjectStore"
#
#   #:?:  i'll figure this out later.
#
# == Description
#
#   This is the class that implements the storage and retrieval of objects for
#   the ObjectStoreService.  This will use ArunaDB as the database manager.
#
# == Caveats
#
#   All objects stored must inherit from the class StorableObject, for
#   the required ability to be a shallow reference.
