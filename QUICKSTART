= MUES Quickstart Guide

This is a rudimentary guide to starting the MUES for the first time. These
instructions will run the server in place without installing it.


== Caveats

These instructions assume a Unix-ish machine. Non-unix instructions shouldn't be
too much different, though. Suggestions for either kind of user welcome.


== Instructions

  $ tar -xzf MUES-x.xx.tar.gz
  $ cd MUES-x.xx
  $ ruby quickstart.rb
