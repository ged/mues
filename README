== General Information

The MUES is a multi-threaded, event-driven Internet game environment server
written in Ruby. It is intended to facilitate the building of online multi-player
games or simulations by providing one or more dynamically-programmed object
environments (worlds), the means to access these environments using a network
client, various useful services or daemons for creating in-game systems, and an
event system for facilitating the interaction of all the parts.

The design of the MUES attempts to assume as little as possible about what sort
of thing an 'environment' is, and so comes with little to no game code. It is
planned to eventually include code for useful game services, such as
linguistics, physics, and a metaclass system for defining the classes which make
up a game environment, but such things are only in their very nascent form in
the current distribution. Community contributions in this area are especially
welcome.


== Caveats

*IMPORTANT*: This is an *alpha* release, a work in progress. It might blow up,
compromise your security, write random data to sensitive portions of your hard
drive, or otherwise fail to work as advertised. It is intended to be used by
developers who are interested in helping out or curious onlookers who don't mind
getting a bit wet.

That said, we would greatly appreciate feedback on any aspect of this
software. Suggestions, feature requests, questions, design critiques, and bug
reports are most welcome. Relevant patches are particularly helpful. We may be
reached at <architects@FaerieMUD.org>, which is a mailing list of parties who
are interested in MUES and FaerieMUD development. You may access the interface
to this and other FaerieMUD-related lists at: <http://lists.FaerieMUD.org/>.

If you're interested in helping out, please read the HACKING file. 

== Installation

For installation instructions (such as they are at this point), see the INSTALL
file.

If you're really impatient and just want to test things out, see the QUICKSTART
document. It includes instructions that should let you get the server up and
running with a minimum of effort.
