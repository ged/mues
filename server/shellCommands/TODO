= To Do - shellCommands

	This is an informal list of commands we intend to implement.

* deleteuser - remove a user from the database.

* kickuser - boot a user from the server, implementor and above(?).

* banuser - ban a user from being on the server, admin and above(?).

* banip - ban an ip set from logging onto the server, admin and above(?).

	Both bans will need to have info about who is doing the banning.

  done already).

* motd - allow an admin to change the message of the day.

* setdefault - set a default shell parameter.

* restart - restart the server.

* reload - reload the config file.

* initmode - turn on/off init mode.

* macro* - commands to deal with creating/editing/deleting macros.
