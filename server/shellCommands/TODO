= To Do - shellCommands

	This is an informal list of commands we intend to implement.

* deleteuser - remove a user from the database.

* kickuser - boot a user from the server, implementor and above(?).

* banuser - ban a user from being on the server, admin and above(?).

* banip - ban an ip set from logging onto the server, admin and above(?).

	Both bans will need to have info about who is doing the banning.

* setuser* - have mutators for all the mutatable user attributes (password is
  done already).

* motd - allow an admin to change the message of the day.

* setdefault - set a default shell parameter.
