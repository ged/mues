= To Do - shellCommands

	This is an informal list of commands we intend to implement.

* deleteuser - remove a user from the database.

* kickuser - boot a user from the server, implementor and above(?).

* ban {user,ip} - ban a user, ip address, or ip range from logging in, admin and above(?).

	Both bans will need to have info about who is doing the banning. This will
	also require some work on the Engine to get it to use the bans. Grep for
	'handle (user|IP) bans here' in lib/mues/Engine.rb to find the necessary
	places.

* banlist - a list of users/ips that are banned, the user that created the ban,
  the date of creation, and the reason.

* promote - Increase a user's privilege level

* demote - Decrease a user's privilege level

* saveuser - commit a user object information to the database.

* motd - allow an admin to change the message of the day.

* setdefault - set a default shell parameter.

* restart - restart the server.

* macro* - commands to deal with creating/editing/deleting macros.
